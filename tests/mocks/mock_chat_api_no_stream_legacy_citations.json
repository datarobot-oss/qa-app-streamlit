    "CITATION_CONTENT_1": "Imagine you want to receive an answer to the question \"Do aliens exist?\" Your best plan to get an answer to this question is to interview a particular stranger by asking \"Did you see anything strange last night?\" If they say \"Yes\", you conclude aliens exist. If say \"No\", you conclude aliens don\\'t exist. What\\'s nice is that you have a friend in the army who has access to radar technology so they can determine whether an alien did or did not show up. However, you won\\'t see your friend until next week, so for now conducting the interview experiment is your best option.",
