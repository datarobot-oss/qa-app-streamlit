    "CITATION_CONTENT_3": "One consideration for choosing an error metric is the expected amount of noise in the data. Different error metrics effectively make different assumptions about the distribution of the noise in the observed output. For example, for very noisy systems you might select an error metric that would give relatively less weight to some large errors (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, IQR Error, Median Error) under the assumption that these large errors may be due to noise in the input data rather than poor model fit. On the contrary, when input data is expected to have very low noise you might select an error metric which heavily penalizes large errors (e.g., R^2 or Maximum Error).\n\n###  Noisy systems {: #noisy-systems }\n\n####  Mean Logarithm Squared Error {: #mean-logarithm-squared-error }\n\n* Mean Logarithm Squared Error uses the log function to squash error values and decrease the impact of large errors.",
