# Need help signing in?

This article addresses common questions related to signing up or signing in to the DataRobot AI Platform or the DataRobot Community.

## Are you signing in to the correct AI Platform?

Make sure that you are logging in to the appropriate region of the DataRobot AI Platform. You must log in to the application based on the region selected when registering your accountâ€”either [app.datarobot.com](https://app.datarobot.com){ target=_blank } or [app.eu.datarobot.com](https://app.eu.datarobot.com){ target=_blank }.

## Do you have the right password?

If you are not sure if you are entering the right password, try a password reset. Note:",0,0,,datarobot_english_documentation/datarobot_docs|en|more-info|biz-accelerators|money-launder.txt,0.0227906704,9,"#### Prompt {: #prompt data-category=gen-ai }
The input entered during chatting used to generate the LLM response.

#### Prompt template {: #prompt-template data-category=gen-ai }
See [system prompt](#system-prompt).",,datarobot_english_documentation/datarobot_docs|en|gen-ai|playground.txt,"**Prompt:** My PrintPro 9001 is making strange noises and not functioning properly. Can you please help me with this?

Save the draft as an LLM blueprint to register it and put it into production.

For more information on the supported versions, see the [Azure OpenAI API reference documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference){ target=_blank }.

The default column name is promptText.",0,"Chatting is the activity of sending prompts and receiving a response from the LLM. Once you have set the configuration for your LLM, send it prompts (from the entry box in the lower center panel) to determine whether further refinements are needed before saving your draft as an LLM blueprint.

![](images/playground-16.png)

Chatting within the playground is a ""conversation""&mdash;you can ask follow up questions with subsequent prompts. Following is an example of asking the LLM to provide Python code for running DataRobot Autopilot:

![](images/playground-9.png)

You could then ask it to make a change to ""that code"" and the LLM responds knowing the code being referenced because it is ""aware"" of the previous conversation history:

Use the playground to test and tune prompts until you are satisfied with the system prompt and settings. Then, click **Save as LLM blueprint** in the bottom of the right-hand panel.",0,0,datarobot_english_documentation/datarobot_docs|en|more-info|eli5.txt,datarobot_english_documentation/datarobot_docs|en|gen-ai|playground.txt,"| Field | Description |
